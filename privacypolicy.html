     <p id="legalbases">  <strong>       3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>



<p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>



<p><strong><i>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</i></strong></p>



<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

<p>&#9679; <strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent.</a><br>

&#9679; <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to comply with their demonstration request<br>

&#9679; <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.<br>

&#9679; <strong>Vital Interests</strong>. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</p>





<p><strong><i>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</i></strong></p>



<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>



<p> In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>

<p> If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way<br>

&#9679; For investigations and fraud detection and prevention<br>

&#9679; For business transactions provided certain conditions are met<br>

&#9679; If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim<br>

&#9679; For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin<br>

&#9679; If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse<br>

&#9679; If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province<br>

&#9679; If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records<br>

&#9679; If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced<br>

&#9679; If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes<br>

&#9679; If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</p>







<p id="whoshare"><strong>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>



<p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>



<p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>

<p>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>



<p id="cookies"><strong>5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</strong></p>



<p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>



<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice: <a href="http://www.keyusa.com/cookiepolicy.html">http://www.keyusa.com/cookiepolicy.html</a>.</p>





<p id="intltransfers"><strong>6. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</strong></p>



<p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</p>



<p>Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?" above), in and other countries.</p>



<p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>



<p id="inforetain"><strong>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>



<p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>



<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than twelve (12) months past the termination of the user's account.</p>



<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>



<p id="infosafe"><strong>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>



<p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>



<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at PrivacyContact at keyusa.com.</p>

You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

<p><strong><u>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</u></strong></p>



<p>We do not process consumer's sensitive personal information.</p>



<p><strong><u>Verification process</u></strong></p>



<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>



<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>



         <p><strong>Other privacy rights</strong></p>

<p>&#9679; You may object to the processing of your personal information.<br>

&#9679; You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.<br>

&#9679; You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.<br>

&#9679; You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.</p>

<p>To exercise these rights, you can contact us by submitting a data subject access request, by email at PrivacyContact at keyusa.com, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document. If you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to hear from you.
